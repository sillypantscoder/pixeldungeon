## How to Play

I'm not giving you pre-compiled stuff or anything like that. (Maybe I will do that sometime later.) Compile the code yourself by running `python3 compiler.py`. It will automatically run the generated code once, but if you want to run it again, you can do `java -jar compiled.jar`.

Use the QWEADZXC keys to move around. (Look at your keyboard. You can move in all 8 directions.) Pressing S sleeps for 1 turn. The enemy will pathfind (badly) towards you. You can look around, there's nothing much interesting yet. (And yet I already have 16 Java files! This is a big project.)
